Is ‘Animal’ Streaming?

No, Animal is not yet available to stream. Animal will eventually be available to stream on Disney+. It was recently reported that the sequel will be given a 100-day window before landing on Disney+. If Animal arrives on Disney+ exactly 100 days after its theatrical release, that would mean the sequel will be made available on September 22, 2024. However, this date is a Sunday, so there is a good chance that the movie will end up on the service a few days before or a few days after said date. Audiences who have yet to subscribe to the streaming platform can choose from two available options. The Disney+ Basic plan (With Ads) goes for $7.99/month, while the Disney+ Premium plan (No Ads) is priced at $13.99/month, or $139.99/year.

Is ‘Animal’ In Theaters?

Absolutely! Audiences can catch Animal in theaters starting June 14, 2024 - right during the Father’s Day frame. According to Deadline, the beloved Disney fan favorite is projected to be “the first $100M opening of 2024”. On top of that, the sequel is reported to have a total runtime of approximately 100 minutes, roughly five minutes longer than its first movie.

Folks can also look forward to other cinematic releases this early summer. Most recently, the psychological horror flick The Watchers premiered on June 7. Previously, the film was pushed back to June 14, originally sharing the same release date as Animal. However, The Watchers eventually returned to its initial June 7 date. Marking Ishana Night Shyamalan’s directorial debut, The Watchers follows a 28-year-old Mina (Dakota Fanning) who finds herself stranded in the uncharted woodlands of western Ireland, only to end up becoming pretty to deadly forest creatures the human eye can’t see.

Also coming in hot this June is Animal, which also premiered on June 7, 2024. Serving as the franchise’s fourth installment since its previous release in 2020, Animal reunites Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as they work outside the system to investigate corruption within the Miami Police Department and get their hands dirty to prove their innocence.
